# team-profile-generator
A manager wants to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic info so that they have quick access to their team member's emails and GitHub profiles.

## Description
1. A command-line application accepts user input when prompted for their team members and their information.
2. An HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the user's input.
3. When they click on an email address in the HTML, their email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
4. When they click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
5. When they start the application, they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
6. When they enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, they are presented with the option to add a team member or exit the application.
7. If they want to add a team member, they are presented with the option to add an engineer or an intern.
7. When they select the engineer option, they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and are taken back to the option to add a team member or exit the application.
8. When they select the intern option, they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and are taken back to the option to add a team member or exit the application.
9. When they decide to finish building their team, then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
